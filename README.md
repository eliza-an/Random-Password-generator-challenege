#Random Password Generator
This is the fifth bootcamp challenge. This assignment consisted of creating a random password generator

## Description

This was the fifth challange of the bootcamp. It's purpose was to create a random password generator following this criteria: 


Generate a password when the button is clicked.

Present a series of prompts for password criteria:

Length of password:

At least 10 characters but no more than 64.

Character types:

Lowercase

Uppercase

Numeric

Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.


This was one of the most challenging projects I have worked on thus far. Practicing javascript turned out to be much more difficult than expected. After a lot of debugging and a tedious amount of errors, I managed to create this application to follow the crietria. Although this assessment was a massive challenge, it taught me an incredible amount. I learned to use new functions and new syntax with javascript. Very interesting project!
